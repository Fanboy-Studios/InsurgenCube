Licence
============
AssaultCube Reloaded, formerly AssaultCube Special Edition, has most of itself released under the Cube Licence.

/source/enet is licenced under the MIT Licence by Lee Salzman.
/packages is special, so read that directory's 'Readme.txt's.
The rest is under the Cube licence.

Cheat Protection
================
AssaultCube Reloaded, formerly AssaultCube Special Edition, highly supports fair play. In fact, that is one of our platforms. We will prevent cheating to the maximum extent possible using code/protocol. Bans are only a last resort, when code cannot be effective enough to prevent cheats, e.g. Wallhacks.

Cube Licence
==============
Please note that a clarification with Wouter van Oortmerssen indicates that Clause 4 applies to all derivative works of Cube.
