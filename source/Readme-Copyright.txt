Licence
============
AssaultCube Special Edition is released under the GLPv3. Please see Readme-GPL3.txt.

Cheat Protection
================
AssaultCube Special Edition highly supports fair play. In fact, that is one of our platforms.
However, this does not mean that you should not cheat.
You may cheat, but only for the purpose of improving this game's anti-cheat.
If nobody cheats, then how will we know how to improve the anti-cheat?

AssaultCube License (Parent licence)
=====================
The AssaultCube source code is mainly based on the cube game/engine and uses the zLib licence.
This modification is allowed due to the licence described.
"The entire AssaultCube package MAY be redistributed"
This is a modification of AssaultCube, redistributing the entire AssaultCube package with the included modifications.
Therefore, this is not a violation of AssaultCube's licence.

Cube Licence (Grandparent licence)
==============
Irrelevant; this is an AssaultCube mod. Their relationships with Cube are not "in our jursdiction".
