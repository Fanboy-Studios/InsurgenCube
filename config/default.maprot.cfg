// minplayer: if set, the server will skip the map, if fewer than required players are connected

// maxplayer: if set, the server will skip the map, if more than allowed players are connected

// skiplines: lines to skip in maprot.cfg, after this map got actually played
//            this can be used to select one of several lines, instead of playing all lines
