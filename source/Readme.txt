Licence
============
AssaultCube Special Edition is released under the GLPv3. Please see Readme-GPL3.txt.

Cheat Protection
================
AssaultCube Special Edition highly supports fair play. In fact, that is one of our platforms. We will prevent cheating to the maximum extent possible using code/protocol. Bans are only a last resort.

AssaultCube License (Parent licence)
=====================
The AssaultCube source code is mainly based on the cube game/engine and uses the zLib licence.
This modification is allowed due to the licence described.

Cube Licence (Grandparent licence)
==============
Irrelevant; this is an AssaultCube mod. Their relationships with Cube are not "in our jursdiction".
