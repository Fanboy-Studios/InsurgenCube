Cheat Protection
================
AssaultCube Special Edition highly supports fair play. In fact, that is one of our platforms.
However, this does not mean that you should not cheat.
You may cheat, but only for the purpose of improving this game's anti-cheat.
If nobody cheats, then how will we know how to improve the anti-cheat?
