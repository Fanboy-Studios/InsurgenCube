Licence
============
AssaultCube Reloaded, formerly AssaultCube Special Edition, is released under the GPL v3. Please see Readme-GPL3.txt.

except /enet, which is licenced under the MIT Licence by Lee Salzman.

Cheat Protection
================
AssaultCube Reloaded, formerly AssaultCube Special Edition, highly supports fair play. In fact, that is one of our platforms. We will prevent cheating to the maximum extent possible using code/protocol. Bans are only a last resort, when code cannot be effective enough to prevent cheats, e.g. Wallhacks.

AssaultCube License (Parent licence)
=====================
The AssaultCube source code is mainly based on the cube game/engine and uses the zLib licence (since the 4th clause no longer applies, it is identical to the zLib licence).
This modification is allowed due to the licence described.

Please note that clause 4 only applies to Cube, and does not apply to AssaultCube. Thus, AssaultCube Reloaded may relicence.

Cube Licence (Grandparent licence)
==============
Cube game engine source code, 20 dec 2003 release.
